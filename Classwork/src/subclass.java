		//ABSTRACT CLASS- similar to a template. has methods, no constructor, no toString-has regular methods. (complete methods written out)
		//sometimes abstract class does or doesn't have code. if code then can use. 
		//if under abstract class, has to have it. (?)
		//higher than abstract class is INTERFACE which has no code and just header line- if using interface, going to have to use methods in ur class

		//in interface, pull from more than one
